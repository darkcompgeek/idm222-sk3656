                        <h1>Graphic Design as a Video Game (Persona 5)</h1>
                        <p>I’ve always wondered what my life as a graphic design student would be like if it were a
                            video
                            game. This video shows me going to the URBN Center (Drexel’s Design Building) and getting
                            some
                            design work done.</p>
                        <p>The UI Design was inspired by Persona 5. I made the assets in Sketch, animated the UI in
                            After
                            Effects, and assembled everything together in Premiere Pro. Some of the UI sounds were taken
                            from Persona 5 and Ace Attorney, while environmental sounds (door opening, id beep, etc.)
                            were
                            recorded on my phone.</p>
                        <p>This project gave me a chance to finally bring an idea I’ve had for a long time to life. It
                            gave
                            me valuable experience in directing a cameraman as well.</p>
