                        <h1>Jagat Magazine</h1>
                        <p>Jagat Magazine is a news magazine targeted towards the younger generation of Indians in their
                            twenties and thirties. It aims to educate them on the social issues going on in their
                            countries.
                            The magazine is in Hindi and English.</p>
                        <p>This issue’s cover story talks about India’s caste system. It talks about Suraj Yengde, a man
                            born into the lowest caste, the Untouchables. Even though Suraj moved to America, the stigma
                            and
                            isolation of being associated with the Untouchables followed him. I focused my creative
                            direction on the concept of a man being split between two countries. This is something I
                            could
                            relate to a lot, since I feel like I’m pulled between my Indian heritage and my American
                            upbringing.</p>
                        <p>
                            This was one of the most personal projects I’ve ever done. I leaned into my Indian heritage
                            and
                            created something unique to me.

                            <figcaption>The design of Jagat’s masthead is meant to evoke the beautiful curves and
                                nuances of
                                Sanskrit. The word “Jagat” is Sanskrit for “changing world,” which perfectly reflects
                                the
                                target audience of the magazine.</figcaption>

                            <figcaption>Throughout the story, I incorporated colors from both the United States flag and
                                the
                                Indian flag to emphasize that dissonance that came from being pulled between two
                                countries.

                            <figcaption>The Hindi pull quote says, “It crushes the heart, but even today I’m still an
                                untouchable.” I thought this was a powerful quote, and I wanted to highlight that in the
                                design.
