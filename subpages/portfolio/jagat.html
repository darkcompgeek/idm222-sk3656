                    <h1>Jagat Magazine</h1>
                    <p>Jagat Magazine is a news magazine targeted towards the younger generation of Indians in their
                        twenties and thirties. It aims to educate them on the social issues going on in their countries.
                        The magazine is in Hindi and English.</p>
                    <p>This issue’s cover story talks about India’s caste system. It talks about Suraj Yengde, a man
                        born into the lowest caste, the Untouchables. Even though Suraj moved to America, the stigma and
                        isolation of being associated with the Untouchables followed him. I focused my creative
                        direction on the concept of a man being split between two countries. This is something I could
                        relate to a lot, since I feel like I’m pulled between my Indian heritage and my American
                        upbringing.</p>
                    <p>
                        This was one of the most personal projects I’ve ever done. I leaned into my Indian heritage and
                        created something unique to me.

                        <figcaption>The design of Jagat’s masthead is meant to evoke the beautiful curves and nuances of
                            Sanskrit. The word “Jagat” is Sanskrit for “changing world,” which perfectly reflects the
                            target audience of the magazine.</figcaption>

                        <figcaption>Throughout the story, I incorporated colors from both the United States flag and the
                            Indian flag to emphasize that dissonance that came from being pulled between two countries.

                        <figcaption>The Hindi pull quote says, “It crushes the heart, but even today I’m still an
                            untouchable.” I thought this was a powerful quote, and I wanted to highlight that in the
                            design.
