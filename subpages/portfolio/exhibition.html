                        <h1>Arts and Crafts Exhibition</h1>
                        <p>For my Exhibition Design final, I had to design an exhibit on the Arts and Crafts Movement. I
                            decided to frame my exhibition around the ongoing debate of “Good Design,” and how William
                            Morris and the Arts and Crafts Movement played into that.
                        </p>
                        <p>This was without a doubt the hardest thing I’ve done at Drexel so far, but it was also the
                            most
                            fun I’ve had working on a project.</p>
                        <p>One wall of the Exhibition is centered on covering the Arts and Crafts Movement, while the
                            other
                            wall covers William Morris and his contributions to pattern design.</p>

                        <h2>William Morris Wall</h2>
                        <p>Because the Arts and Crafts Movement was all about appreciating hand-created designs, I paid
                            special attention to the materials I used my exhibition. The pattern designs are printed on
                            fabric to create a tactile quality, encouraging the viewer to feel the patterns on the wall.
                        </p>
                        <p>The use of wood throughout the exhibition demonstrates how the Arts and Crafts designers
                            looked
                            to nature and the countryside for inspiration.</p>

                        <h2>Arts and Crafts Movement Wall</h2>
                        <p>
                            This side of the exhibition introduces viewers to the debate of Good Design. The exhibition
                            shows how the Arts and Crafts movement emerged as a reaction to the decline in design
                            because of
                            machine-production.
                        </p>
                        <p>The right portion of the wall is an edge to edge screen, showing a data-driven version of one
                            of
                            William Morris’s patterns. On the iPad mounted onto the green panel, viewers can answer
                            questions and contribute to the Good Design debate. Their answers are reflected in the
                            colors
                            shown in the data-driven pattern.</p>

                                the
                                exhibition and encourages viewers to feel the fabric.</figcaption>

                        <p>The wood paneled flooring brings a sense of unity to both walls, creating a sense of interior
                            space. Impactful quotes from William Morris and John Ruskin are laid on the floor, grabbing
                            the
                            attention of viewers walking from either direction.</p>
