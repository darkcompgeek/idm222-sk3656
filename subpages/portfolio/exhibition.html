                    <h1>Arts and Crafts Exhibition</h1>
                    <p>For my Exhibition Design final, I had to design an exhibit on the Arts and Crafts Movement. I
                        decided to frame my exhibition around the ongoing debate of “Good Design,” and how William
                        Morris and the Arts and Crafts Movement played into that.
                    </p>
                    <p>This was without a doubt the hardest thing I’ve done at Drexel so far, but it was also the most
                        fun I’ve had working on a project.</p>
                    <p>One wall of the Exhibition is centered on covering the Arts and Crafts Movement, while the other
                        wall covers William Morris and his contributions to pattern design.</p>

                    <h2>William Morris Wall</h2>
                    <p>Because the Arts and Crafts Movement was all about appreciating hand-created designs, I paid
                        special attention to the materials I used my exhibition. The pattern designs are printed on
                        fabric to create a tactile quality, encouraging the viewer to feel the patterns on the wall.</p>
                    <p>The use of wood throughout the exhibition demonstrates how the Arts and Crafts designers looked
                        to nature and the countryside for inspiration.</p>

                    <h2>Arts and Crafts Movement Wall</h2>
                    <p>
                        This side of the exhibition introduces viewers to the debate of Good Design. The exhibition
                        shows how the Arts and Crafts movement emerged as a reaction to the decline in design because of
                        machine-production.
                    </p>
                    <p>The right portion of the wall is an edge to edge screen, showing a data-driven version of one of
                        William Morris’s patterns. On the iPad mounted onto the green panel, viewers can answer
                        questions and contribute to the Good Design debate. Their answers are reflected in the colors
                        shown in the data-driven pattern.</p>

                        <figcaption>The introductory “What makes design good?” panel is screen-printed onto a canvas
                            fabric, which will be hung from the wall. The use of canvas adds a tactile quality to the
                            exhibition and encourages viewers to feel the fabric.</figcaption>

                    <p>The wood paneled flooring brings a sense of unity to both walls, creating a sense of interior
                        space. Impactful quotes from William Morris and John Ruskin are laid on the floor, grabbing the
                        attention of viewers walking from either direction.</p>
