                <h1>Hi! I'm Sai.</h1>
                <p>As long as I can remember, I've had a passion for design and storytelling. I grew up sketching User
                    Interface Designs in class, and I wrote a lot of short stories of short stories as a kid.</p>
                <p>Eventually, this continued interest led me to Drexel, where the rigorous Graphic Design Program
                    helped me
                    push my skills even further. To this day, I apply the same passion for design and storytelling in my
                    work.</p>
                <p>
                    I have experience in many areas of design, such as print, branding, and web. My ambition and
                    dedication
                    to quality drives me as I work. If I don't know a piece of software, I rigorously teach it to
                    myself.
                </p>
                <p>When I'm not designing, I love to read, explore techology, and explore Philly.</p>
